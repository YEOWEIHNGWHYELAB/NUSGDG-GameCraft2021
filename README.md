<br />Game Story:
You are stuck in a warzone and you are a wizard who is physically weaker than the others. But with magic 
you can turn the tables. You can a turn into a Voodoo and then turn your opponent's strength against themselves. 
In other words, you can lose (take damage deliberately in voodoo mode) in order to win (kill your opponents)!

<br />GamePlay: 
Your objective is to escape the enemy infested map through the portal. Your main weapon is the VooDoo pin which can be used to pin your enemy, you can damage that particular enemy by getting hit by the arrow that is shot by that particular enemy. Getting hit by other enemy will damage yourself. Each VooDoo pin can last a duration of 5 second once it is stuck onto an enemy, make good use of this time to get hit by that particular enemy struck by the VooDoo pin. In this game, there are four different enemies shown with different tint (green, red, blue, yellow). They have different behaviour and are always in patrol mode until when the player get close to it. 

- Green - Melee only. (Starts chasing player within a distance)

- Blue - Shooting only. (Within a certain distance from player, it will start moving closer to player 

before stopping and shooting.)

- Red - Melee & Shooting. (Within a certain distance from player, it will start moving closer to player 

before stopping and shooting. If the player move any closer to it, it will start moving close to the 

player and attack player with melee).

- Yellow - Shooting only. (Will chase player all the time).

Enemies can be pushed away if you are being cornered or unable to run away from enemy. Some objects like boxes are movable which can be moved out of the way to clear the path or used as a shield!

Damaging a say red enemy will also inflict damage to all other red enemies in the game.

If your pin intercepts with an enemies' arrow, the enemies arrow will overpower your pin making it useless, so time your shot correctly!
